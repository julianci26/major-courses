# Major-Courses for Computer Science and Information Technology

### Introduction

The field of **Information Technology (IT)** is essential for exploring numerous opportunities to develop solutions through programming and networking, especially in areas like database management, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. While **Computer Science (CS)** shares some foundational concepts, IT focuses more on the practical application of technology to solve real-world problems in business and industry.

In my **IT studies**, I have been exposed to a blend of technical knowledge and hands-on skills. My coursework has centered around topics like **Database Management**, **UNIX/Linux System Administration**, and **Web Development**, all of which are crucial for maintaining and optimizing IT infrastructure in organizations. Courses in **Cloud Computing**, **Network Security**, and **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** have given me the ability to design, implement, and manage large-scale technology solutions.

I’ve also learned the importance of ensuring secure and efficient systems, which has become more critical in today’s digital age. Through my experience in **Network Security** and **UNIX/Linux System Administration**, I’ve gained the skills to protect systems from cyber threats and manage complex IT networks. This has further deepened my understanding of the practical aspects of IT, particularly in the context of businesses and industries that rely on technology for their daily operations.

While IT focuses more on the application and maintenance of existing technologies, I’ve developed strong problem-solving techniques, programming skills, and a solid understanding of network management. These skills are crucial for resolving practical issues in the workplace, ensuring systems run smoothly, and driving innovation within an organization.

Overall, my IT education has equipped me with the knowledge and hands-on experience required to excel in the fast-paced world of technology, whether in system administration, network management, or IT services.
